            <a href= "https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials" target="_blank" ><h2>GIT</h2></a>
            <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you
                have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
                Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one
                source.

                So regardless of whether you write code that only you will see, or work as part of a team, Git will be
                useful for you.</p>

            <a href= "https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/" target="_blank"> <h2>VENV PYENV</h2></a>
            <p>A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate
                by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that
                most of the Python developers use.
                <br>
                Pyenv lets you manage multiple versions of Python on your computer.

            <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
                high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
                attractive for Rapid Application Development</p>

            <a href= "https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial" target="_blank"><h2>SQL</h2></a>
            <p>SQL (pronounced “ess-que-el”) stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a
                database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for
                relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on
                a database, or retrieve data from a database.</p>

            <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" target="_blank"><h2>HTML CSS</h2></a>
            <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and
                web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                <br>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look
                and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It
                is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used
                with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

            <p>Python Web framework is a collection of packages or modules that allow developers to write Web
                applications or services. With it, developers don’t need to handle low-level details like protocols,
                sockets or process/thread management.</p>
